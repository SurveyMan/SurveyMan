<a class="anchor"><span class="octicon
   octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to SurveyMan.</h3>

<p>
  Surveys are widely used across the social sciences, business, and
  even the natural sciences to draw conclusions about human behavior.
  When important, high-stakes decisions are being made on the basis
  of such tools as surveys, we hope that the inferences that lead to
  those decisions are sound.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, bugs creep into surveys, much in the same way that
  bugs creep into computer programs : authors of surveys neglect edge
  cases, they introduce bias, and they fail to consider how the survey
  will be recieved in the wild. Many of these bugs are well-known
  to those who use surveys regularly in their research. Practitioners
  handle these bugs by running pilot studies and performing post-hoc
  statistical analyses on the results obtained, ensuring the quality
  of their responses.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, there are some bugs that are not as widely known, and
  there are some bugs that cannot be diagnosed through post-hoc
  analyses. SurveyMan addresses these problems by controlling the
  experimental setup of a survey. By automating large portions of the
  deployment and debugging of surveys, SurveyMan allows the
  experimenter to conduct reliable, repeatable surveys on the web at scale.
